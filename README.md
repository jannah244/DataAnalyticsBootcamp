During my journey on this Camp, I had the opportunity to work on this projects with the guidance by instructor. Below are descriptions of projects that I completed:

#Superstore Project
In my Superstore Analysis project, I embarked on a journey of data analytics by exploring a dataset from the Superstore retail business. This involved in-depth data cleaning, transformation, and analysis within Excel and Pivot Tables, leveraging thousand records. The main goal was to find interesting things in the data that could discover on identifying which states/region and customer names had the highest sales within each product category by the end of 2019. The important part of this project is a user-friendly Sales Dashboard that shows all the cool stuff we found in the data. This project is like a guide that helps everyone understand what's happening at the Superstore and how we can make it even better.
