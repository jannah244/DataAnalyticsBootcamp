# DataAnalyticsBootcamp
During my journey on this Camp, I had the opportunity to work on this projects with the guidance by instructor. Below are descriptions of projects that I completed:

# Superstore Project
In my Superstore Analysis project, I embarked on a journey of data analytics by exploring a dataset from the Superstore retail business. This involved in-depth data cleaning, transformation, and analysis within Excel and Pivot Tables, leveraging thousand records. The main goal was to find interesting things in the data that could discover on identifying which states/region and customer names had the highest sales within each product category by the end of 2019. The important part of this project is a user-friendly Sales Dashboard that shows all the cool stuff we found in the data. This project is like a guide that helps everyone understand what's happening at the Superstore and how we can make it even better.

# Final Year Project (Student Performance Report)

This project was done by me and presented to my instructor. This focus on analyzing and presenting the performance of male and female students. The report delves into math, reading, and writing scores to provide insights into gender-based differences in academic performance.

Dataset: Student Performance Prediction Data Set (Kaggle)

Problem Statements 
Here are three problem statements we can analyze:
1. Analyze the impact of socio-economic factors on student performance (such as races/parental education/type of lunch)
2. Examine the relationship between exam preparation and student performance 
3. Investigate the combined impact of multiple factors on student performance (total scores)

Hypothesis
Four common hypothesis will be analyse that can affect  student performance:
- Does race/ethnicity affect?
- Does their parents education can affect?
- Does the type of lunch affect their performance?
-Does their exam preparation affect too?
